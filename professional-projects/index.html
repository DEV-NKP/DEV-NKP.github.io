    problem: "A major workplace safety organization overseeing 1,800+ Ready-Made Garment factories in Bangladesh faced significant operational challenges in managing their comprehensive safety inspection programs. The organization relied on manual processes for tracking structural, electrical, fire, and boiler safety inspections, creating bottlenecks in data collection and reporting. Their existing system lacked efficiency in handling occupational safety complaints, managing remediation programs, and coordinating safety training initiatives across multiple factory locations. Without a centralized platform, the organization struggled to ensure transparency in safety compliance, track corrective action plans effectively, or provide real-time insights to stakeholders including government agencies, global brands, and trade unions. These operational inefficiencies directly impacted worker safety and regulatory compliance in a critical industrial sector.",
